## Practice - json-server filter
As a code ninja, add a button to view only the logged in user's posts. Add a method to the DataManager to retrieve only the logged in user's posts. Refer to the [documentation for json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## Practice 
Your friends have asked if they can use your journal app. Include login and register functionality. You may also need to refactor the database calls to include a userId and only show posts related to the logged in user. Edits can only be made to the posts related to the user.

### Bonus #1
Allow users that are not logged in to have limited functionality like viewing other member's posts The ability to save a GiffyGram requires a login.

### Bonus #2
Refactor the login and register components into one form. If a user is not found, automatically register the user and display the app.
